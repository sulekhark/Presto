This test case is from demo benchmark: E2EDemoR

test command:
python3 ../../refine.py edb_to_refine.txt < named_cons_cr_lf_cr.txt.ee > t
To refine all edb tuples:
python3 ../../refine.py  < named_cons_cr_lf_cr.txt.ee > t


to check: diff with ref_out after sorting both ref_out and t
Note: ref_out is produced with edb_to_refine.txt
